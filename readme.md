So when I am doing this assignment I build three package one for the base function, one for the implementation, and one for
the ui. Mathops is the base function, then in calculator I use mathops to build the implementation. I add a new function
to output based on the operation and number provided by the request struct and a new math which is power. Then in ui i
build the api so my web could use the /calculate end point to calculate by the json in response struct.
